## Sales Data Analysis

### Project Description: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of E-commerce Sales Data

**Introduction:**
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from an e-commerce dataset to gain insights into sales trends over time and identify the best-selling products. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to extract meaningful information from the dataset to support business decision-making.

**Objective:**
The main objectives of this project are:
- Analyze sales trends over time by examining monthly sales.
- Determine the best-selling products based on revenue and quantity sold.
- Visualize the findings to communicate insights effectively.

**Data Source:**
The dataset used in this project is assumed to be in Excel format and contains information about e-commerce sales transactions. It includes attributes such as Order Date, Ship Date, Sales, Profit, Quantity, Product Name, etc.

**Methodology:**

**Data Preparation:**
- Load the dataset and convert date columns (Order Date, Ship Date) to datetime format.
- Handle missing values by dropping or filling them as appropriate.
- Convert necessary columns to appropriate data types (e.g., numeric).

**Analysis:**
- Calculate the total sales revenue.
- Aggregate sales data to analyze trends over time, particularly monthly sales.
- Identify the top-selling products based on revenue and quantity sold using groupby operations.

**Visualization:**
- Visualize monthly sales trends using a line plot to observe any patterns or seasonality.
- Create bar plots to display the top 10 best-selling products by revenue and quantity sold.
- Customize the plots with appropriate titles, labels, and colors for better interpretation.

**Key Findings:**
- Monthly Sales Trends: By analyzing monthly sales trends, we can identify peak periods and seasonal variations in sales.
- Best-Selling Products: The analysis reveals the top-performing products in terms of revenue and quantity sold, providing valuable insights into customer preferences and market demand.

**Conclusion:**
Through this exploratory data analysis of e-commerce sales data, we have gained valuable insights into sales trends and product performance. These insights can help stakeholders make informed decisions, such as optimizing marketing strategies, inventory management, and product offerings, to enhance overall business performance and profitability.

## Titanic Survival Prediction

### Project Description

**Introduction:**
The Titanic Survival Prediction project delves into historical data from the RMS Titanic disaster to explore factors influencing passenger survival. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to predict whether passengers survived or not, shedding light on the dynamics of the tragic event.

**Objective:**
The primary objectives of this project include:
- Predicting survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic.
- Analyzing the impact of various passenger attributes such as age, gender, and ticket class on survival probability.
- Evaluating the performance of machine learning models in predicting survival.

**Data Source:**
The dataset utilized in this project contains detailed information about Titanic passengers, including attributes like age, gender, ticket class, and survival status. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and testing predictive models.

**Methodology:**

**Data Preprocessing:**
- Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Cleaning and formatting the data to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**
- Utilizing a Random Forest classifier to predict survival outcomes based on passenger attributes.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

**Analysis:**
- Investigating the importance of various features in predicting survival through feature importance analysis.
- Examining survival patterns across different passenger demographics and ticket classes.

**Conclusion:**
Through the Titanic Survival Prediction project, we aim to gain insights into the factors influencing passenger survival during the Titanic disaster. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can uncover patterns and trends in the data, contributing to a better understanding of historical events and their impact on human life.
